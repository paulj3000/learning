# Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-001: Parent-owned accounts

Status: Accepted

Children use parent-managed profiles rather than independent email accounts.

## ADR-002: Deterministic engine before AI

Status: Accepted

Adventure progression and correctness are controlled by application code. AI enhances dialogue, hints, and bounded variation.

## ADR-003: Structured AI output

Status: Accepted

AI responses must conform to runtime-validated schemas and authorized action IDs.

## ADR-004: No open-ended child chat in MVP

Status: Accepted

All child AI interactions occur inside a defined adventure or curated question flow.

## ADR-005: Persistent world consequences

Status: Accepted

Adventure completion creates visible, durable world changes to connect learning with meaningful outcomes.

## ADR-006: Household co-presence adventures, no communication channel

Status: Proposed

Two `ChildProfile`s under the same `ParentProfile` may share a single adventure
instance and see each other's avatar, position, and discrete in-game actions
in real time (for example, "child B placed a plank in slot 3"). No field,
transport, or UI surface carries free-form input — text, voice, image, or
drawing — from one child to another. The only signal that ever crosses
between children is validated game state, the same shape of event the
deterministic engine already authors and validates today (CLAUDE.md
section 7).

This is explicitly distinct from, and does not change, CLAUDE.md section 12's
exclusion of child-to-child messaging and social networking. Those remain out
of scope. This ADR covers presence with zero communication surface only —
there is nothing here to moderate because there is nothing expressive to
carry.

**Scope for v1:** participants must belong to the same `ParentProfile`
(siblings/household). Cross-family pairing is deliberately excluded.

**Why household-only is an architectural constraint, not just a safety
preference:** every model in the current schema (`amplify/data/resource.ts`)
uses `allow.owner()` authorization scoped to a single Cognito identity. Two
`ChildProfile`s under one `ParentProfile` already share that identity, so a
shared session record stays readable and writable under the existing owner
rule with no new authorization primitive. Cross-family pairing would require
a new sharing/authorization model (per-session grants across owners) — a
separate, larger decision, not an incremental extension of this one.

**Deferred, not part of this decision:**
- cross-family pairing or matchmaking of any kind;
- any communication surface, including closed-vocabulary/canned-phrase
  exchange;
- continuous cursor/telemetry-level presence — v1 ships discrete action
  events plus join/leave presence only;
- shared or merged island world state across children — each child's own
  island still receives its own `WorldChange` record.

See `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` (`CoopSession`) and `docs/ADVENTURE_ENGINE.md`
("Co-op sessions") for the corresponding spec. Sequencing note: this ADR's
feature now ships as Phase 17 in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, after the world engine
(Phase 9) and Story Engine (Phase 12) are stable, since presence UI has
nothing to render without an avatar/world to show it in.

## ADR-007: Phaser as the world-engine rendering library

Status: Accepted

Learning Adventure Island adopts an explorable, avatar-controlled world
(`docs/LEARNING_ADVENTURE_ISLAND_EXPLORABLE_WORLD_ROADMAP.md`), replacing
the earlier, narrower "Motion and Embodiment" plan for `docs/ROADMAP.md`
Phase 9. That plan assumed the existing hand-rolled Canvas 2D +
`requestAnimationFrame` approach from `ChattyAvatar.tsx` would scale up to
tilemaps, camera follow, collision, sprite animation, and NPC interaction.
It does not: those are exactly the concerns a 2D game engine exists to
solve, and hand-rolling them risks becoming an unmaintained, undertested
game engine embedded inside a learning app.

Learning Adventure Island adds **Phaser** (`phaser` on npm) as the renderer
for the explorable world, per the source roadmap's section 7
recommendation. This is a deliberate exception to CLAUDE.md section 13's
"do not silently introduce a new dependency" — it is introduced here
explicitly, with the parent's approval, specifically because Phase 9's
scope (tilemaps, collision, camera, sprite animation) is what it is built
for.

**What does not change:**
- `ChattyAvatar.tsx`'s Canvas 2D approach remains the pattern for small,
  self-contained portraits and icons (companion portrait, plank-count
  icons) — it is not retrofitted into or replaced by Phaser.
- The deterministic Adventure Engine (ADR-002), structured AI output
  (ADR-003), and server-side correctness remain unchanged. Phaser is a
  presentation-layer addition only; it never decides correctness,
  progression, or safety disposition.
- No foundation-model or network code runs inside a Phaser scene.

**Layering constraint (roadmap section 40), now an architectural rule:**

```text
World Engine (Phaser: movement, maps, animation, collision)
     -> Story Engine (chapters, scenes, narrative state, bounded choices)
     -> Adventure Engine (deterministic challenge progression, validation, hints)
     -> Learning Rules / AI Companion (evaluation / narration, never both)
     -> World State (permanent consequences, unlocks, discoveries)
```

No layer takes over responsibilities belonging to another layer. In
particular, Phaser scenes may fire `WorldInteraction` events but must never
themselves validate an answer, award progress, or call an AI route
directly — those cross a React/world-event-bus boundary into existing,
already-audited code paths.

**Testing implication:** Phaser requires a real Canvas/WebGL rendering
context that jsdom does not provide, so scene code is kept thin and
Phaser-specific (uncovered by unit tests beyond smoke-level
mount/unmount checks with `phaser` mocked); all game *logic* — the world
event bus, the world object/interaction registry, requirement checks — is
written as plain, Phaser-free TypeScript so it stays unit-testable.
